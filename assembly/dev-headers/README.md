This directory contains the ASM files to be used with ADB.
ADB (Assembly Debug Bridge) is the system to hot load code into PAT80 without needing to flash a rom chip. It works by selecting ADB command in the Memory Monitor running from ROM and sending the binary file via the Python Terminal Emulator (CTRL+A).
The binary file must be compiled using files in this folder because these files contain an instruction to set the starting memory address to the address used by the Monitor to load the application data into RAM.
